1. Fundamental of Testing
    - What is Testing?

        Testing is a process of evaluating a system or software to determine its functionality, performance, or other attributes, with the aim of identifying defects or validating its conformance to requirements. It involves executing various test cases, analyzing results, and ensuring that the system meets the desired quality standards before deployment.
    - Typical Objectives of Testing
        - Finding Errors and Bugs in System
        - Ensure that system will meet specific requirement or not
        - improve its quality, reliability, and user satisfaction
    - Testing & Debugging

        Testing is the process of verifying system or software will meet the specific requirement or not and debugging is the finding and fixing of errors and defects of the code.
    - Quality Assurance and Testing

        Quality insurance is broader set of activities about SDLC to get high quality product and Testing is finding and fixitng errors and defects in system to meet specified requirements.
    -  Errors, Defects, and Failures

        Errors are mistakes made during the development process, defects are the presence of faults in the software, and failures occur when the software does not perform as intended, often due to errors or defects.
    - Defects, Root Cause and Effect

        Defects are flaws or issues in a product, root causes are the underlying reasons for those defects, and effects are the impacts that result from the presence of defects.
