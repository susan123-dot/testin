1. Fundamental of Testing
    - What is Testing?

        Testing is a process of evaluating a system or software to determine its functionality, performance, or other attributes, with the aim of identifying defects or validating its conformance to requirements. It involves executing various test cases, analyzing results, and ensuring that the system meets the desired quality standards before deployment.
    - Typical Objectives of Testing
        - Finding Errors and Bugs in System
        - Ensure that system will meet specific requirement or not
        - improve its quality, reliability, and user satisfaction
    - Testing & Debugging

        Testing is the process of verifying system or software will meet the specific requirement or not and debugging is the finding and fixing of errors and defects of the code.
    - Quality Assurance and Testing

        Quality assurance is broader set of activities about SDLC to get high quality product and Testing is finding and fixitng errors and defects in system to meet specified requirements.
    -  Errors, Defects, and Failures

        Errors are mistakes made during the development process, defects are the presence of faults in the software, and failures occur when the software does not perform as intended, often due to errors or defects.
    - Defects, Root Cause and Effect

        Defects are flaws or issues in a product, root causes are the underlying reasons for those defects, and effects are the impacts that result from the presence of defects.

    - Seven Testing Principles
        - Testing shows the presence of defects
        
            Testing helps to uncover defects and identify areas of weakness in the software.
        - Exhaustive testing is impossible
        
            It is impossible to test all possible combinations and scenarios, so testing efforts should be focused on high-risk areas.
        - Early testing
        
            Testing activities should start as early as possible in the software development life cycle to identify and address defects early on.
        - Defect clustering
            
            Typically, a small number of modules or components contain the majority of defects, so testing efforts should be concentrated on those areas.
        - Pesticide paradox
            
            Repeated testing with the same test cases can lead to diminishing returns, so test cases need to be regularly reviewed and updated.
        - Testing is context-dependent

            Testing strategies and techniques should be tailored to suit the specific context of the project, including its objectives, risks, and constraints.
        - Absence of errors fallacy
            
            The absence of detected defects does not guarantee the absence of defects, so testing cannot guarantee a defect-free software, but it can help mitigate risks and improve software quality.
    - Types of Testing
        - Unit Testing

            It invloves testing the individual components of the software.
        - Integration Testing

            This type of testing is used to check interaction between different components of the software.
        
        - System Testing

            It involves in testing the entire system to identify that all components are working together or not.
        - Acceptance Testing

            It is the process of determining that system meets user's requirement or not.  
        - Usability Testing

            It evaluates the software's user friendliness and how easy to use.
        - Recovery Testing

            It involves in testing the software ability to recover from crashes or failures.
        - Functional Testing

            This type of testing verifies that the software functions as intended and meets the specified functional requirements.
        - Performance Testing

            It involves testing the software's performance and responsiveness under different load conditions to assess its scalability, speed, and stability.
        - Security Testing

            It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software to protect it from potential security threats.
        - Regression Testing

            It involves retesting the modified or added parts of the software to ensure that the changes have not introduced any new defects or issues.
        - Compatibility Testing

            This testing verifies that the software is compatible with different operating systems, browsers, devices, or other software configurations.
        - Explorotary Testing

            It is an ad hoc testing approach where testers explore the software without any specific test scripts, aiming to uncover defects and gain insights.
        - Load Testing

            It tests the software's performance under expected load conditions to assess its stability and response time.
        - Stress Testing

            This type of testing evaluates the software's behavior and performance under extreme conditions or beyond its normal operational capacity.
        - Localization Testing

            It checks if the software is properly adapted to meet the requirements of a specific locale or language.
    - Test Process
        - Test Design
            In this initial stage, the test objectives, scope, and strategy are defined. Test planning involves identifying the testing goals, establishing the test deliverables, determining the test environment and resources, and creating a test plan that outlines the testing activities and schedules.
        - Test Planning
            In this stage, test scenarios, test cases, and test data are developed based on the requirements and design specifications. Test design involves identifying the test conditions, creating test cases to validate each condition, and preparing the necessary test data to execute the tests.
